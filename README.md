# Circuit Analysis
Circuit analysis involves determining the voltages and currents in each component of an electrical circuit.

Here are some fundamental techniques and concepts used in circuit analysis:

Techniques and Concepts
1. Ohm's Law:
  
   $\large V=IR$

2. Kirchhoff's Laws:

- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL): The sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

  $\large \sum V = 0$

  - Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL): The sum of currents entering a node is equal to the sum of currents leaving the node.
