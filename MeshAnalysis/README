Mesh analysis (also known as loop analysis) is a method used to calculate the current in each loop of a circuit. Itâ€™s based on Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit must be zero.

Steps for Mesh Analysis:
Identify independent loops in the circuit.

Assign loop currents to each independent loop.

Apply KVL to each loop, writing equations for the sum of voltage drops.

Solve the simultaneous equations to find the loop currents.
