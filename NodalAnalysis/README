Nodal analysis is a powerful method in circuit analysis used to determine the voltage at each node in an electrical circuit. This method is based on Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents entering and leaving a node must be zero.

Steps for Nodal Analysis:
Identify all nodes in the circuit.

Choose a reference node (ground). This node will have a voltage of 0V.

Assign voltage variables to the remaining nodes.

Apply KCL to each of the nodes (except the reference node), writing equations for the sum of currents.

Solve the simultaneous equations to find the node voltages.
